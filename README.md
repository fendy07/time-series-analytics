# Time Series Analytics Using Statistical and Deep Learning Approach

## Time Series Analysis Repository

<p>This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of Time Series Analysis, which employs both Statistical Approaches and Deep Learning techniques. The primary goal is to compare these methodologies for modeling and evaluating forecasting models, which are essential in various fields such as finance, economics, environmental science, and more.</p>

## Overview of Time Series Analysis

Time Series Analysis involves examining datasets that are collected over time to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations. The importance of this analysis lies in its ability to help stakeholders make informed decisions based on historical data. 

## Statistical Approaches

Statistical methods, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), Exponential Smoothing, and Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL), are foundational in time series forecasting. These techniques rely on established statistical theories and are well-suited for linear relationships found in data. Here are some key points:
ARIMA Models: ARIMA models are popular for their ability to handle different types of time series data, including those with trends and seasonality. For example, ARIMA can be used to forecast stock prices or sales figures based on historical data patterns.
Seasonal Decomposition: This technique breaks down a time series into its constituent components: trend, seasonality, and residuals. This decomposition allows for a better understanding of underlying patterns, which can improve forecasting accuracy.

## Deep Learning Approaches

On the other hand, Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful tool for time series forecasting, particularly with the advent of models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). These neural network architectures are adept at capturing complex, non-linear relationships in data. Here are some insights:
LSTM Networks: LSTMs are designed to remember information for long periods, making them ideal for time series data, which often has long-term dependencies. For instance, LSTMs can be employed to predict weather patterns or stock market trends based on several years of historical data.
GRUs: Similar to LSTMs, GRUs are another type of recurrent neural network that can be more computationally efficient while still providing robust performance in time series forecasting.

## Purpose of the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive comparison between the statistical and deep learning approaches to time series forecasting. By doing so, users can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method, as well as guidance on when to use one over the other. 

## Key Features
 - Implementation Examples: The repository includes practical implementations of both statistical and deep learning models, allowing users to easily replicate results and modify parameters to fit their specific datasets.
 - Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of the forecasting models, various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are detailed. These metrics help in determining how accurately a model performs against its predictions.
 - Visualizations: Visual representations of the data, along with forecasted results, are provided to facilitate an intuitive understanding of model performance. Graphs and plots can illustrate trends, seasonal patterns, and the accuracy of predictions over time.

## Conclusion

In summary, this repository serves as a valuable resource for practitioners and researchers interested in Time Series Analysis. By leveraging both statistical and deep learning approaches, users can develop robust forecasting models tailored to their specific needs. Whether you are looking to predict financial markets, analyze sales trends, or understand climate change patterns, this repository equips you with the necessary tools and knowledge to successfully navigate the complexities of time series data.
